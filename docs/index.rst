Overview
--------

VeloC is a multi-level checkpoint-restart runtime for HPC supercomputing infrastructures and large-scale data centers. 
It aims to delivers high performance and scalability for complex heterogeneous storage hierarchies without sacrificing ease 
of use and flexibility.

Checkpoint-Restart is primarily used as a fault-tolerance mechanism for tightly coupled HPC applications but 
is essential in many other use cases: suspend-resume, migration, debugging. Some applications need to save their state and
revisit such previously saved states as part of the execution model (e.g. adjoint computations), which can be also addressed
using the checkpoint-restart pattern.

VeloC is a collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the
Exascale Computing Project.
