# VELOC: VEry-Low Overhead Checkpointing System

VeloC is a multi-level checkpoint/restart runtime that delivers 
high performance and scalability for complex heterogeneous storage 
hierarchies without sacrificing ease of use and flexibility.

It is primarily used as a fault-tolerance tool for tightly coupled
HPC applications running on supercomputing infrastructure but is
essential in many other use cases: suspend-resume, migration, 
debugging.

VeloC is a collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory and 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the Exascale 
Computing Project.

## Documentation

The documentation of VeloC is available here: http://veloc.rtfd.io

It includes a quick start guide as well that covers the basics needed
to use VeloC on your system.
